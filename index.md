# Islamic Theological Contradiction Regarding Torah Dietary Restriction

###### Content derived from David Wood's Video titled: [Christianity, Islam, and Pork: How Zakir Naik Condemns Muhammad!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PupDC2gA5-4)

## Islamic Argument (derived from Dr. Zakir Naik)
Dr. Zakir Naik mentions Lev 11:7-8 and Deut 14:8 to note the importance of following the dietary laws of the Torah and claims that **"if [one] breaks one law ... from the Old Testament, [they] shall not enter 
[heaven]."**
> #### Leviticus 11:7-8
> 7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
> 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
>
> #### Deuteronomy 14:8
> 8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

In supporting his argument, Dr. Naik provides a quote from Jesus, where Jesus says *"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." (Mark 5:17).*
His logic can briefly be summarized as follows: Jewish law bans pork, and Jesus affirms Jewish law. Therefore, Christians, who eat pork, are condemned.

## Issue?
Islamic sources narrate stories where Muhammad fails to follow the Jewish dietary restrictions which Dr. Naik mentions. Furthermore, the Quran tells muslims to not abide by the Jewish law.

## Explanation
Before moving to Islamic sources, let's see in more depth the parts of the Torah that Dr. Naik uses as a proof that Jewish law bans pork. 
> #### Leviticus 11:1-8:
> 1 And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
> 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
> 3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
> 4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the **camel**, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
> 5 And the **coney**, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
> 6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.
> 7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
> 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.

> #### Deuteronomy 14:6-9
> 6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
> Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the **camel**, and the hare, and the **coney**: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.
> 8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.
> 9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:

Note that these two verses are verses that surround the same OT verses that Dr. Naik uses in his arguments.

Moving to the Islamic sources, we find the following sources from Sahih al-Bukhari which narrate that the prophet ate animal meat were banned in the Torah.
*Sahih al-Bukhari 2572 and 2485* narrate that Muhammad used to eat rabbit and camel, respectively, thus by meaning that he has broken the Jewish law that muslims usually accuse Christians
of breaking.

> #### Sahih al-Bukhari 2572
> Narrated Anas: We chased a **rabbit** at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. (The narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, Did the Prophet; eat from it? Anas replied, He **ate from it**. )

> #### Sahih al-Bukhari 2485
> Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij: We used to offer the Asr prayer with the Prophet and slaughter a **camel**, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would **eat** the cooked meat before sunset.

Furthrmore Quran allows muslims to eat camel:
> #### Quran 22:36
> And the **camels** and cattle We have appointed for you as among the symbols of Allah ; for you therein is good. So mention the name of Allah upon them when lined up [for sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful.

At one point, the Quran orders muslims to not follow Jewish law. 
> #### Quran 2:208
> O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.

According to **Tafsir Ibn Kathir**, this ayah can be explained as follows: **"Allah thus commanded them to embrace the legislation of the religion of Muhammad in its entirety and to avoid abandoning any part of it. They should no longer adhere to the Tawrah."**

## Conclusion?
Dr. Naik's argument that anyone who breaks one of the laws of the Torah goes to hell is self-contradictory. We can see that Islam does not have enough ground to say that Christians are condemned for eating pork and trespassing the dietary laws of the Torah, as their own prophet has (repeatedly) trespassed the same dietary laws. Even the Quran "abolishes" the Torah!
